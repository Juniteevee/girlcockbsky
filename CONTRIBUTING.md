## How to contribute?
1. Clone the repo
2. cd
3. Use the `shell.nix` file, or use some other shenanigans, i dont care.

### Subfolders:
- `app` :
  - `pnpm i && wrangler dev`
 
- `api` :
  - `pnpm i && tsc && node dist/index.js`
 
I don't really enforce a branch naming convention, but please, refrain from making a PR if you have pushed your changes on the `mistress` branch.
Same with commits, just make them readable and understandable at first glance.

Submit your changes!
